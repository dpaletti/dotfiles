# configs

Some configs I'd rather not lose:
- [fish.config](./fish.config): fish shell configuration for a reasonably working shell. This is meant to be used with [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) terminal. 
- [git.sh](./git.sh): set globally some settings far more reasonable than the defaults, also sets (my) username and mail
